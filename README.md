## How to run the tool

### Run with Docker

1. Create `.env` file in the root directory of the project, copy and paste the below config. Replace the `OPENAI_API_TOKEN` configuration value with your key `{OPENAI_API_KEY}`. Other properties are optional to change and be default.

```bash
OPENAI_API_TOKEN={OPENAI_API_KEY}
EMBEDDER_LOCATOR=text-embedding-ada-002
EMBEDDING_DIMENSION=1536
MODEL_LOCATOR=gpt-3.5-turbo
MAX_TOKENS=200
TEMPERATURE=0.0
DROPBOX_LOCAL_FOLDER_PATH="./documents"
```

2. From the project root folder, open your terminal and run `docker compose up`.
3. Navigate to `localhost:8501` on your browser when docker installion is successful.

### Run from the source

2. Download and Install [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) to manage project packages.
3. Create an [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) account and generate a new API Key: To access the OpenAI API, you will need to create an API Key. You can do this by logging into the [OpenAI website](https://openai.com/product) and navigating to the API Key management page.


Then, follow the easy steps to install and get started using the sample app.

#### Step 1: Clone the repository

This is done with the `git clone` command followed by the URL of the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sohlost/rag-llm-QnA-App/
```

Next,  navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd rag-llm-QnA-App
```

#### Step 2: Set environment variables

Create `.env` file in the root directory of the project, copy and paste the below config, and replace the `{OPENAI_API_KEY}` configuration value with your key.

```bash
OPENAI_API_TOKEN={OPENAI_API_KEY}
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=8080
EMBEDDER_LOCATOR=text-embedding-ada-002
EMBEDDING_DIMENSION=1536
MODEL_LOCATOR=gpt-3.5-turbo
MAX_TOKENS=200
TEMPERATURE=0.0
DROPBOX_LOCAL_FOLDER_PATH="./documents"
```

#### Step 3: Install the app dependencies

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

#### Step 4: Run the App

You start the application by running `main.py`:

```bash
python main.py
```
